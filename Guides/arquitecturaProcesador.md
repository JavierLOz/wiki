# Processor Architecture

## Central Procesing Unit:

The **Central Procesing Unit**, known as **CPU** for short acts as the computers brain this is because the CPU is the electronic circuit inside the computer that is tasked with doing all the instructions the users asks. Like basic 
maths, logical comparisons and controling the input and output (I/O).

Below you can see a simplified diagram descriping what the CPu contains. You can see that the arithmetic logit unit (ALU) and the control unit (CU) are contained inside de CPU as well as the register bank which in this diagram is represented by the memory unit, all of which we will explain with detail later.
