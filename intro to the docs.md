Hi and welcome. 

This md was introduced to make ir easier to read the docs, so if you have no idea what is happening, you came to the right place.

There is an index don below if you need help navigating.

## Dev boards

This are the type of dev boards we have used. We have 1 variety:

### Dev board type c

This is the main controller, where everything connects to. 

I manages instructions, and this is where we upload the main code to.

## Images

The following images are used for tother markdowns, but still you can find them

## Motors

There are different kinds of motors we use, and we will display some of them here, however, you can find [more info here][motors]

### Stepper motors

This kind of motors are controlled through angles, or better yet, angle changes. We can determine its velocity, but it needs a controller for them to work.

### Brushless motors

This kind of motor have only speed control. However, they hold lots of it, with decent amounts of torque.

### Others

We also use permanent magnet, Series-Wound DC and Shunt-Wound DC

## Guide

The guide will help you start your coding adventure.

You can find it [here][docGuide]

# PDFs

There is a lot of robomasters documentation available in PDFs, we have gathered the most important and you can watch them in display under [the PDFs folder][pdf]

# Suggested tools

In here, you can learn about the tools we use, as well as a small intro to Linux and WSL.

There are 3 guides:
- [Intro][LinuxIntro]
- [First steps][LinuxNoob]
- [Terminal][LinuxTerminal]
